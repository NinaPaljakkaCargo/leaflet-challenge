# leaflet-challenge
-----------------------------
In this challenge I have created an interactive map on a web-page using HTML, CSS, JS, and Leaflet. This particular map displays the most significant earthquakes occurring in the last month (30 days). Markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size (larger size, larger magnitude) and depth of the earthquake by color (greater depth, darker color).

-Files Included:

  - index.html: main HTML code for web page
  - style.css: CSS code for web-page styling
  - logic.js: main JS and leaflet code for calling data, creating the map and markers, and displaying to web-page
